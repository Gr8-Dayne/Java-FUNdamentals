###### Credit

- Got the @Before assertion idea from Micah. Although I didn't need to use it, I wanted to try it out.



## LAB TWO and THREE

- Assignment was initially submitted on time, resubmitted later.

#### Rolling Dice

- Once I got the test working, I was able to correctly utilize a for loop and Math.Random

#### Contains Duplicates

- Found an excellent model after hours of troubleshooting here: https://www.techiedelight.com/check-duplicates-array-java/

#### Calculating Averages

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-average-array-iterative-recursive/

- this website was instrumentle in my understanding of this part of the assignment

#### Arrays of Arrays

- This one was tough, I took TA James' advice and iterated through the arrays and returned the lowest average.

#### Analyzing Weather Data

- After learning how to use the toString method with Linked Lists, I applied what I could and it started working.

#### Tallying Election

- Using the provided list, I iterated through it twice, once looking for how many times a name appeared and adding a "vote" with the name as a key and again to see what name appeared the most to declair the "victor".

#### Linter

- Using the guidlines and the provided gates.js file, I was able to find the errors that were being thrown by the gates file. Then based on the gates file I created, I created several other files as apecified in order to carry out the rest of the assignment.
